What is odoo modul:
Odoo modules support a wide range of business functions such as sales, procurement, finance and warehouse management.
The modules provide a unified and coherent platform for managing business processes.

How to make a module:
__init__.py
In Odoo, the __init__.py file allows the module to become a Python package, making the module's source code more structured.
You can often initialize your Odoo module in this file, for example set up file import or other initial steps.

__manifest__.py:
 the manifest file for Odoo modules, which contains metadata and configuration related to the module.
Information in this file includes the module name, version, author, description, dependencies, installation instructions, and more.
The manifest file is essential for the Odoo system, as it is based on this information that modules are installed, updated and managed.

Animated snippets:
Animated snippets have visual appeal and help grab users' attention.
These are dynamic elements that can be easily inserted into Odoo web pages and reports.
With animated snippets, information can be presented easily and visually, thus increasing the user experience.

xml.files:
These XML files describe how data is displayed in the user interface, how forms, views, access rights, and more can be configured.
